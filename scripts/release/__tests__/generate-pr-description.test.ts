        ## To do

        Before merging the PR, there are a few QA steps to go through:

        - [ ] Add the \\"freeze\\" label to this PR, to ensure it doesn\\'t get automatically forced pushed by new changes.

        And for each change below:

        1. Ensure the change is appropriate for the version bump. E.g. patch release should only contain patches, not new or de-stabilizing features. If a change is not appropriate, revert the PR.
        2. Ensure the PR is labeled correctly with \\"BREAKING CHANGE\\", \\"feature request\\", \\"maintainance\\", \\"bug\\", \\"build\\" or \\"documentation\\".
        3. Ensure the PR title is correct, and follows the format \\"[Area]: [Summary]\\", e.g. *\\"React: Fix hooks in CSF3 render functions\\"*. If it is not correct, change the title in the PR.
            - Areas include: React, Vue, Core, Docs, Controls, etc.
            - First word of summary indicates the type: ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù, ‚ÄúFix‚Äù, ‚ÄúUpgrade‚Äù, etc.
            - The entire title should fit on a line

        This is a list of all the PRs merged and commits pushed directly to \\\`next\\\`, that will be part of this release:
